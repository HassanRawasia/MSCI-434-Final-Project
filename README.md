# MSCI-434-Final-Project

## Introduction
In the dynamic landscape of fresh food supply chains, it is essential to prioritize the timely delivery of high-quality food products while upholding the industryâ€™s efficiency and sustainability standards. However, the perishability of fresh food products poses significant challenges for the industry. Approximately 119 billion pounds of food is wasted in the United States every year, equating to 130 billion meals or $408 billion in food being thrown away - this is 40% of all the food in America (Food Waste in America, 2023). Not all of this waste is created in the production and transportation of foods, but it is certainly one of the major points of failure in fresh food supply chains. Estimates say that between 40% to 70% of fresh food is damaged or wasted in the supply chain due to poor storage conditions and handling (Food Waste in America, 2023). To address this pressing issue, the robust modeling of quality degradation is essential in any linear programming optimization of fresh food supply chains.

By properly incorporating the dependency of food quality on supply chain variables, corporate decision makers can devise strategies which will not only optimize the typical logistical processes, but also improve the freshness of the food we eat and reduce the amount of wasted product.

## Purpose
The purpose of this report is to examine the transportation problem in the context of a meal kit delivery service, with a focus on the quality degradation of fresh foods due to transportation conditions and packaging selection in the supply chain.

## Optimization Model
The optimization model was developed on python. It can be found [here](https://github.com/HassanRawasia/MSCI-434-Final-Project/blob/main/MSCI434_S23_Team26_SupplyChainNetworkDesign.ipynb/).

## Extension to the Optimization Model
The extension of the model was developed on python. It can be found [here](https://github.com/HassanRawasia/MSCI-434-Final-Project/blob/main/MSCI434_S23_Team26_SupplyChainNetworkDesign_Extension.ipynb/).
